## Problem
The company aims to improve its loan approval process by ensuring that creditworthy customers—those who can reliably repay loans—are not unjustly rejected. 
At the same time, the company needs to maintain an acceptably low default rate to minimize financial risk and avoid issuing loans to high-risk applicants. 

## Goals
As a Data Scientist Intern at Home Credit, I'm involved in a project to improve the decision-making process for credit applications through a data-driven machine learning model that better assesses the creditworthiness of applicants.
I have to build a predictive machine learning model that determines whether credit should be approved or not based on applicants' financial and credit history data.
