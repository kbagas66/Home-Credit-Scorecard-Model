## Problem
The company aims to improve its loan approval process by ensuring that creditworthy customers—those who can reliably repay loans—are not unjustly rejected. 
At the same time, the company needs to maintain an acceptably low default rate to minimize financial risk and avoid issuing loans to high-risk applicants. 

## Goals
As a Data Scientist Intern at Home Credit, I am working on a project to improve the decision-making process for credit applications by building a data-driven machine learning model that more accurately assesses applicants' creditworthiness based on their financial and credit history.
